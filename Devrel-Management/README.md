# Devrel Product Management

Two core things to remember before we start diving into the content. Here's what matters: **turning concepts into actions** and **sharing knowledge note features**.

### General

In this section, there will be a few concepts, models and smaller thing presented that I considered meaningful, from the perspective of DevReal Team manager or even DevRel org head. Others not working on managerial positions should also find it helpful in order to understand over-arching goals of the whole DevRel structure.

The first thing is **AAARRRP Model** by [Phil Legetter](https://twitter.com/leggetter)

The other one is **DevRel Pillars 3 C's Model**, which consists of three key elements

* Code
* Content
* Community

Next one is understanding DevRel and its fields as a whole but also splitted into smaller fields. Those two assets by [hoopy.io](https://hoopy.io/) should make it all clear.

### KPIs

This applies to pretty much everyone, not only managers. If you don't measure your efforts and performance you don't know if you make progress. Without a quantifiable sense of where you are vs. where you were, you can’t know (in any meaningful way) whether you’ve succeeded or not.

* Developer Community Product Manager KPIs
  * Followers / Members
  * Engagement (discussions / comments / shares / retweets / re-posts)
  * Referral traffic from your community
  * Number of new signups and discussions
  * Active members
  * Questions asked vs Questions answered

Not everything you can measure, should be measured. Don’t be a data puker, be a data analyst. Be laser focused on the things that matter & provide actionable insights

**Developer Experience Metrics**
  * **Quality**: Net Promoter Score
  * **Quantity**: Program Members
  * **Activity**: User Engagements

**GitHub Repos Health Metrics**

* **Contributor-Breadth**:  the ratio of non-core committers to core committers. This metric indicates how open a community is to contributions from outside
* **Contributor-Demographics**:  gender, age, location, education, and skills over time
* **Contributors**: number of contributors
* **Issue-Response-Rate**: time between a new issue is opened and a maintainer responds
* **Followers**: number of followers
* **Forks**: number of forks
* **Bus-Factor**: the minimum number of developers performing 50% of commits
* **Closed-issues**: number of close issues
* **Code-Commits**: number of code commits
* **Transparency**: number of comments per issue
* **Watchers**: number of watchers
* **Issue-Resolution-Efficiency**: number of closed issues / number of abandoned issue
* **Issues-Submitted-Closed**: issues submitted vs issues closed
* **Code-Merge-Duration**: what's the duration of time between code merge request and code commit
* **CommunityActivity**: frequency of contributions
* **IssueComments**: number of comments per issue
* **NewContributors**: number of new contributors over time
* **OpenIssueAge**: age of an open issue
* **OpenIssues**: number of open issues
* **PRsComments**: number of comments per pull request
* **PRsMadeClosed**: pull request made vs pull requests closed
* **PRsOpen**: number of opened pull requests
* **PRsOverTime**: how many pull requests have been submitted over time
* **NewContributorsMaintainers**: ratio of new contributors to maintainers

Remember that the number itself isn’t the goal — it’s the process of tracking them over time and finding patterns in the data that can inform project and process improvements

### DevrelManager

If you want to become a successfull Devrel team / org , Developer Product Manager try to incorporate those thoughts:

* There should be a right balance between KPIs / dashboards and interacting and listening to developers
* Make users better at what they want to do not thinking what you want them to do
* Developers don't have much time
* Upgrade your users not your product
* They want to hack your product to their usecases
* There is no point trying to fix something that your organisation doesn't want to fix
* Public Roadmaps - by sharing in advance what you’re planning with your users, you can help them make much smarter long-term decisions

Apart from all that do not forget about constant growth, crafting and executing a vision and above all empowering your team!
