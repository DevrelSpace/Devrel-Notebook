This one is about building trust at scale. Before you start diving into this repo I just want you to remember one thing: **Developer Relations is a JOB AND NOT a LIFESTYLE**. Don't be mislead by all those DevRel people constantly tweeting. Although charisma can be faked, DevRel also requires genuine enthusiasm for your platform or product, so let's start learning!

In short what Developer Relations is about:

**Developer Relations is about**:
  * Outreach (online and in person)
  * Community
  * Product
  * Education and support

**Its core elements:**
* **Awareness** - awareness of the platform and what it does
* **Acquisition** - sign-up/download/install
* **Activation** - actively using the platform in an application
* **Retention** - continue to use the platform, use of new/additional features and use in new apps
* **Revenue** - pay to use the platform
* **Referral** - tell others about the platform
* **Product** - involvement in building and getting feedback on product
