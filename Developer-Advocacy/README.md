### Definitions

Here are a few core things that should be the main responsibilities of Developer Advocates:

* Represent developers' interests to influence product roadmap (product, docs, tooling feedback)
* Feeds back into the product strategy and roadmap and developer support offering (docs, forums)
* Defends feature requests
* Supporting Pre-Sales

The core part of Developer Advocacy is feedback. Your goal here is to reach the core need of the person that is passing the feedback. A person who gave a piece of feedback should know what happened with their feedback and how was it used. That makes them feel heard and keeps them motivated to continue to share more meaningful feedback in the future.

**Developer advocates build communities that generates new advocates**
