## Notes

You can find here all the loose notes that we've written down during DevRel field research, making notes and pretty much creating this repo. Hope they'll be somewhat useful in your present and future DevRel endeavours! ðŸ––

* When you're asked about ROI and you think it's shit just don't come up with some number (**it's about trust**)
* Not everything of value can be measured
* When making products we should think about them that what we deliver is a finished even when delivery is incremental
* If youâ€™re a great external communicator but you canâ€™t get anything shipped for developers because you have no credibility with the product team and you arenâ€™t becoming more senior in the organisation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* When you're traveling it can be hard to work out every day
* Ensure a workout happens just about every day you're not on the road.
* Devrel job is a very flexible one so you need to make extra effort to make it more static
* Do not stay in front of the computer for more than 8 hours a day

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fly less, write more
* You need an event strategy and plan to execute (so as not to waste your attendance at the event)
* If you're attending conferences network, if you're on behalf of your company then collect developers feddback
* If you're travelling for a conference always go for your health (even if they have talks that are interesting for you, choose the flight that allows you to get back home earlier and rest)
